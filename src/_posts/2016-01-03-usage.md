### Data Source

First, add location information to your posts YAML front-matter:

  ```yaml
  # _posts/2016-01-01-post.md
  location:
    latitude: 51.5285582
    longitude: -0.2416807
  ```

Alternatively, you can add location info to your custom collection's documents or even in data files:

  ```yaml
  # _data/places.yaml
  - title: "Paris"
    url: "http://google.fr"
    location:
      latitude: 48.8587741
      longitude: 2.2074741
  
  - title: "Madrid"
    url: "http://google.es"
    location:
      latitude: 40.4378698
      longitude: -3.8196204
  ```
  
If your post has an `image` in its front-matter data, this image will be used as a content for the popup when marker is clicked.
Otherwise simple "View" text link will be placed in the popup.
  
By default this plugin will display location from the page it's placed on:

  ```
  {% raw %}
  {% google_map %}
  {% endraw %}
  ```
  
But you can use `src` attribute to load locations from other places, like posts, collections or data files!

For example, this map will show locations from all posts from 2016:

  ```
  {% raw %}
  {% google_map src="_posts/2016" %}
  {% endraw %}
  ```
  
This map will show locations from a collection called 'my_collection':

  ```
  {% raw %}
  {% google_map src="_collections/my_collection" %}
  {% endraw %}
  ```  

This map will show locations from all data files located in 'my_points' sub-folder:

  ```
  {% raw %}
  {% google_map src="_data/my_points" %}
  {% endraw %}
  ```
  
You can configure map's dimensions and assign custom CSS class to the element:

  ```
  {% raw %}
  {% google_map width="100%" height="400" class="my-map" %}
  {% endraw %}
  ```
  
### Filters

You can also filter which locations to display on the map!<br/>
For instance, following tag will only display locations from posts which have `lang: en` in their front-matter data.

  ```
  {% raw %}
  {% google_map src="_posts" lang="en" %}
  {% endraw %}
  ```

### Marker Cluster

By default [Marker Clusterer](https://github.com/googlemaps/js-marker-clusterer) is enabled.
If you have many markers on the map, it will group them and show icon with the count of markers in each cluster - [see example](https://googlemaps.github.io/js-marker-clusterer/examples/advanced_example.html).

If you don't want to use marker cluster, you can disable it globally in `_config.yml`:

  ```yaml
  maps:
    google:
      marker_cluster:
        enabled: false
  ```

Or you can disable it per single map tag:

  ```
  {% raw %}
  {% google_map no_cluster %}
  {% endraw %}
  ```
